title: 1 Game a month!
---

Last month to practice and improve my C++ skills I decided to participate on the 1 Game a Month challenge, since the idea was to develop one game per month from scratch I decided to create a code repository with my own game engine / framework and improve it every month by challenging myself by making a bigger game each month.

In March I put together a C++ project using SDL2 and OpenGL to create a pong clone, the intention was to take my time to setup a project and understand how SDL integrates with OpenGL and mouse and keyboard input to make something simple.

I finished it earlier than I expected and even though it was a simple start I enjoyed the process.

Here is the link for the project [Link](https://gitlab.com/TiagoJSM/SimpleEngine), unfortunatelly I can't show it through a tag.

This month I expect to work on something a bit more challenging and start to use more complex shaders and textures.
